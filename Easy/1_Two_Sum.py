STATEMENT
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

CLARIFICATIONS
 - Each input has exactly 1 solution
 - The same element may not be used twice
 - The list is not empty
 - The list is not necessarily sorted

EXAMPLE: 
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]
